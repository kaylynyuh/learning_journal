#LJ Code 201 Day 11
===
Today we did some code review on the salmon cookie project which I found really helpful. One thing I like most about doing code review as a class is that it helps me understand how to read other people's code as well as gain insight from others and their interpretations/questions about the code that I may have not thought of myself. 

Our lab melted my brain slightly but, yet again, the suffering was also full of lots of learning. I feel like the more I spend time in lab working on these problems, the more comfortable I feel working with JS as the consistency is helping everything stick.
