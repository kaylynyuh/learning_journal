##LJ Code 201 Day 8
###What I Learned Today
- event handlers and listeners
- forms and form validation
- how to apply/utilize forms/events
- more with constructors

During lecture I was able to follow along and understand everything conceptually, however, later on when I had to apply what I learned my brain/thought processes locked up. I need to work on domain modeling and not allowing problems to overwhelm me. 

If I think them through methodically and thoughtfully I'll be in better off which is something I that will work on coquer. Although today's lab didn't go over smoothly in the beginning, I was able to learn from the mistakes and work through the struggle points. 

My struggles are not ideal but I'm learning from them and getting closer to a better understanding. Channeling my inner growth mind set!
