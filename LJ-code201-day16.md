#LJ Code 201 Day 16

Today was another productive day working on the project with the team. I think the biggest take away from the day was learning and understanding the importance of good variable and function naming.

One of the biggest challenges we came across was not being able to understand the code that we had produced because of poor naming on variables and functions. After we did a thorough code review and re-established logical and simple names for the variables and functions our code became readable again.

Although it was a headache for all of us, it was a great learning experience and reminder that naming variables and functions appropriately is huge when it comes to reading/understanding your code.
