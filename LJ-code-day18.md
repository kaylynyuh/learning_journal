#LJ Code 201 Day 18
===
Yesterday was a very productive day with the finalization of the group project and getting the website deployed. A big learning curve for me was learning how to add gauges apporpriately to display generated results pulled from algorithms used in the JS. 

Aside from the group project, I also gained a lot of insight from the JS presentation during lunch. I was able to learn and gain a general understanding behind prototypal inheritance and how to create new methods and properties for new instances of an object without changing that original object's prototype.
