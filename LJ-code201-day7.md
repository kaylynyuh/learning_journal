##LJ Code 201 Day 7
###More Awesome Things I Learned Today
- writing objects in constructor notation
- using JS to create a table
- more with accessing and traversing the DOM

What I liked most about class today was learning how to use constructor notation to turn the object literals we created in lab yesterday into object constructors. I found constructor notation more strait forward and easier to understand conceptually. I still have more learning/practice to do when it comes to object constructors and creating tables with JS but I feel like I have a general understanding.
