##LJ Code 201 Day 5
###Awesome Things I Learned Today 

- some more CSS
	- fixed positioning/ floats
- git branching
 	- creating a new branch
	- pushing/ merging branch back to master 	
- how to implement and define functions to assist in solving problems
- how to assign the results of a function to a variable for later use

I liked the challenges I faced today while working on the lab assignment. Although the answers didn't come immediately and without struggle, being able to think about each problem and how to break it down in order to find a solution was a very enlightening learning experience. I hope to become more comfortable with functions and how to write/ use them appropriately for any given scenario.
