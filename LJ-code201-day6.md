##LJ Code 201 Day 6
###More Awesome Things I Learned 
- traversing/manipulating the DOM
- nodelists
- domain modeling
- more about CSS floats and absolute positioning

Today was another learning day full of new concepts and challenging lab work. What I liked most about today was being able to utilize my general knowledge of a problem domain for the lab assignment. Although answers didn't come immediately, I was able to work out the problem and code a solution. I'm still working on domain modeling in the sense that I'm still learning how to create a conceptual model for a specfic problem. Figuring out a plan and how to execute it is something that I will continue to work on and get better at.
