#LJ Code 201 Day 13
===
For today's class we did another code review, learned some more about CSS, and were introduced to local storage and how to use it with our data. 

Like always, I found the code review really insightful as it gave me a chance to see someone else's thought processes for tackling the same problem as well as learn new things from their code that I couldn't figure out how to work in mine.

In regards to local storage, I found the lecture to be pretty strait forward, although after reading the lab struggled to come to an immediate conclusion on how to implement that for my page. Learning concepts in lecture is one thing and learning how to actually implement those new concepts in lab is another.
