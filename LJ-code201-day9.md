I enjoyed the pace of class today as it gave me a chance to catch up, review important concepts, and focus on the styling of my webpage and experiment with CSS. I enjoy CSS although I know I need to work on writing cleaner code as well as continue practicing with JS as that's where I need the most improvement. I plan on spending this weekend reviewing the JS components we've covered thus far and really focus on establishing a good understanding so I can come to class on Monday with more knowledge.
