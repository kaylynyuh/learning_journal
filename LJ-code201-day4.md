#LJ Code 201 - Day 4

##Awesome Things I Learned Today

- how to create JS functions
- pair programming
- more about decisions and loops
- resolving merge conflicts
- how git aids in collaborative programming
- how long debugging can take... but more importantly how to find solutions for broken pieces of code

Today I saw the benefits of pair programming and how much of a difference it makes in a thorough overview and revision of code. Having someone with skills that can compiment your own as well as a fresh pair of eyes looking at your code really makes a difference in the quality of the finished product. It was also nice to see how to use git accordingly with the process.
