#LJ Code 201 - Day 3

##Awesome Things I Learned Today
- how to engage in code review
- how to create a GH repo
- how to use MOU
- decisions and loops




```
I learned several new things today and was introduced to important concepts in JS (decisions and loops). Although I felt challenged by the homework assignment I'm excited to dissect the code that I have and try to understand it more. Looking forward to more new things!
