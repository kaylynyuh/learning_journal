#LJ Code 201 Day 14
===
Today I learned how to resolve merge conflicts as well as how to create basic CSS animations. I found the lab assignment for the day to be a particularly useful exercise as it gave me a better feeling of what to expect in regards to work flow and the team dynamic that I'll soon be facing for the final project.

Communication is key and I think our team got a good taste of the best way to go about delegating tasks, working on a problem domain, and prioritizng deadlines today. Let the insanity commence!
