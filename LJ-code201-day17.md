#LJ Code 201 Day 17

Today the team and I were able to make a lot of progress with the website and achieve a MVP. We got the most important features working as well as all of the styling done. 

This project has been great in helping to build my understanding of JS and get more comfortable writing it and understanding how to use it to achieve certain tasks. Although I still have more room to grow, I'm in a much better spot than I was just a week ago.

I'v also been able to refine my CSS skills and practice styling which is another great aspect of this project experience. Thus far, it has been very beneficial to my learning.
