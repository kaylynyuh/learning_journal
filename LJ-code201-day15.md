#LJ Code 201 Day 15 

###All About Project Week
===
The end of this week was all about getting situated with our groups for project week, establishing a project domain, assigning tasks, and project proposal.

What I liked most about class on Thursday and Friday was gaining insight on how to work collaboratively with a team and come together to establish an organized work flow. 

Working in a group setting effectively and efficiently is common in this career field so I'm more than happy to see what it's like and am ready to learn/grow from the experience.
