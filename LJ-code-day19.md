#LJ Code 201 19
===
Today was awesome, mostly because it was a day full of reflection as it was the final day of 201. Also, I was excited to finally present the final project with the team as well as listen to other classmates and see what they created.

Looking back on my 201 experience, I can't believe the amount of information I learned in just four short weeks. Although I frequently felt stuck in the weeds and like I wasn't making any progress, looking back on it all really puts into perspective how much my knowledge grew throughout the course, more than I could've imagined at the time.

This experience has been one of the most challenging experiences but also the most rewarding. Not only did I learn about code but I also learned a lot about myself and will continue doing so throughout the rest of my time here at Code Fellows.
